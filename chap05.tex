Ask anyone who's spent more than a minute in Richard Stallman's presence, and you'll get the same recollection: forget the long hair. Forget the quirky demeanor. The first thing you notice is the gaze. One look into Stallman's green eyes, and you know you're in the presence of a true believer.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
如果谁和理查德在一起，呆上超过一分钟，他的感受一般都是这样：不管他那一头的长发，不管他怪异的举止，给人印象最深刻的，是理查德凝视你的眼神。透过他绿色的眼睛，你能看到一种真实的信仰。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
To call the Stallman gaze intense is an understatement. Stallman's eyes don't just look at you; they look through you. Even when your own eyes momentarily shift away out of simple primate politeness, Stallman's eyes remain locked-in, sizzling away at the side of your head like twin photon beams.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
要说理查德眼神犀利，都要算是轻描淡写了。他不止是看着你，他简直就是要看透看穿你的心。哪怕你出于礼貌，暂时把自己的视线从他身上移开，你依旧能感受到他的眼神像灯塔一样，锁定在你的身上。

Maybe that's why most writers, when describing Stallman, tend to go for the religious angle. In a 1998 \textit{Salon.com} article titled ``The Saint of Free Software,'' Andrew Leonard describes Stallman's green eyes as ``radiating the power of an Old Testament prophet.''\endnote{See Andrew Leonard, ``The Saint of Free Software,'' \textit{Salon.com} (August 1998), \url{http://www.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/cov_31feature.html}.} A 1999 \textit{Wired} magazine article describes the Stallman beard as ``Rasputin-like,''\endnote{See Leander Kahney, ``Linux's Forgotten Man,'' \textit{Wired News} (March 5, 1999), \url{http://www.wired.com/news/print/0,1294,18291,00.html}.} while a \textit{London Guardian} profile describes the Stallman smile as the smile of ``a disciple seeing Jesus.''\endnote{See ``Programmer on moral high ground; Free software is a moral issue for Richard Stallman believes in freedom and free software,'' \textit{London Guardian} (November 6, 1999), \url{http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/nov/06/andrewbrown}.

These are just a small sampling of the religious comparisons. To date, the most extreme comparison has to go to Linus Torvalds, who, in his autobiography -- see Linus Torvalds and David Diamond, \textit{Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary} (HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001): 58 -- writes, ``Richard Stallman is the God of Free Software.''

Honorable mention goes to Larry Lessig, who, in a footnote description of Stallman in his book -- see Larry Lessig, \textit{The Future of Ideas} (Random House, 2001): 270 -- likens Stallman to Moses:

\begin{quote}
\ldots as with Moses, it was another leader, Linus Torvalds, who finally carried the movement into the promised land by facilitating the development of the final part of the OS puzzle. Like Moses, too, Stallman is both respected and reviled by allies within the movement. He is [an] unforgiving, and hence for many inspiring, leader of a critically important aspect of modern culture. I have deep respect for the principle and commitment of this extraordinary individual, though I also have great respect for those who are courageous enough to question his thinking and then sustain his wrath.
\end{quote}

In a final interview with Stallman, I asked him his thoughts about the religious comparisons. ``Some people do compare me with an Old Testament prophet, and the reason is Old Testament prophets said certain social practices were wrong. They wouldn't compromise on moral issues. They couldn't be bought off, and they were usually treated with contempt.''}

也许这就是为什么，很多描写理查德的文章，都会从信仰的角度开始写起。在1998年salon.com上的一篇文章，标题定为《自由软件圣徒》。作者安德鲁·伦纳德描述理查德那双绿色眼睛的时候，写道：“[它们] 散发出一种旧约中先知般的力量\endnote{参见安德鲁·伦纳德的文章《自由软件圣徒》，1998年8月：\url{http://www.salon.com/21st/feature/1998/08/cov_31feature.html}}。”1999年《\textit{连线}》杂志的一篇文章中，形容理查德的络腮长胡须好似拉斯普京\endnote{译注：拉希普京，全名葛列格里·叶菲莫维奇·拉斯普京。沙俄末期的一名颇受争议的东正教教徒。当时的沙皇尼古拉二世和皇后亚历山德拉笃信神秘主义，拉希普京便因此得宠。后被尤苏波夫亲王、狄密翠大公、普利希克维奇议员等人合谋刺杀。}的胡须一般\endnote{参见利安得·克尼的文章《被Linux遗忘的人》，《连线》，1999年3月5日： http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1999/03/18291}。《伦敦卫报》则把理查德的微笑说成好似“门徒看到耶稣”一般\endnote{参见《有操守的程序员；坚持自由，坚持自由软件的理查德·斯托曼》，《伦敦卫报》，1999年11月6日；http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/1999/nov/06/andrewbrown 。把理查德比作宗教信徒的文章还有很多。Linux的作者Linus Torvalds曾用更极端的语言把理查德比作宗教信徒。参见他的自传《好玩而已：一场无意间发起的革命》Just For Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary，HarperCollins Publishers, Inc., 2001，第58页：理查德是自由软件之神。}。 ..................

Such analogies serve a purpose, but they ultimately fall short. That's because they fail to take into account the vulnerable side of the Stallman persona. Watch the Stallman gaze for an extended period of time, and you will begin to notice a subtle change. What appears at first to be an attempt to intimidate or hypnotize reveals itself upon second and third viewing as a frustrated attempt to build and maintain contact. If his personality has a touch or ``shadow'' of autism or Asperger's Syndrome, a possibility that Stallman has entertained from time to time, his eyes certainly confirm the diagnosis. Even at their most high-beam level of intensity, they have a tendency to grow cloudy and distant, like the eyes of a wounded animal preparing to give up the ghost.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
这些比喻有一定道理，但似乎也有不足。它们都忽视了理查德人格中脆弱的一面。盯着理查德的眼睛再久些，你会发现其中潜在的改变。一开始，是一种强势带着几分催眠般的眼神；可再看几次，就会发现那眼神其实是在寻求沟通，建立联系。如果他个性中真的有着一些自闭症的成分，那么他的这种眼神倒确实符合这种个性。哪怕当他目光如炬地盯着你的时候，你依旧能够感受到他眼神中透出的几分迷茫和疏远。恰似受伤的猛兽一般，眼中传出的有几分绝望。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
My own first encounter with the legendary Stallman gaze dates back to the March, 1999, LinuxWorld Convention and Expo in San Jose, California. Billed as a ``coming out party'' for the ``Linux'' software community, the convention also stands out as the event that reintroduced Stallman to the technology media. Determined to push for his proper share of credit, Stallman used the event to instruct spectators and reporters alike on the history of the GNU Project and the project's overt political objectives.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
我第一次见识传说中理查德的目光，是在1999年3月的第一届LinuxWorld大会上。大会在加利福尼亚州的圣何塞市举行，是一场“Linux”社区的大聚会。其中一个环节，就是在媒体面前介绍理查德。理查德决心在这次见面上简要回顾GNU工程的历史以及这个工程政治上的目标，以此说明自己在社区中的工作和价值。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
As a reporter sent to cover the event, I received my own Stallman tutorial during a press conference announcing the release of GNOME 1.0, a free software graphic user interface. Unwittingly, I push an entire bank of hot buttons when I throw out my very first question to Stallman himself: ``Do you think GNOME's maturity will affect the commercial popularity of the Linux operating system?''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
作为一个报道此次大会的记者，我在GNOME 1.0的媒体发布会上，被理查德亲自上了一课。当时，我的第一个问题在无意之中触碰到了敏感话题：“请问您觉得随着GNOME逐渐成熟，是否会推进Linux的商业应用？”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``I ask that you please stop calling the operating system Linux,'' Stallman responds, eyes immediately zeroing in on mine. ``The Linux kernel is just a small part of the operating system. Many of the software programs that make up the operating system you call Linux were not developed by Linus Torvalds at all. They were created by GNU Project volunteers, putting in their own personal time so that users might have a free operating system like the one we have today. To not acknowledge the contribution of those programmers is both impolite and a misrepresentation of history. That's why I ask that when you refer to the operating system, please call it by its proper name, GNU/Linux.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“请你不要再把整个操作系统都叫做Linux。”理查德回应，眼光迅速聚焦到我的身上：“Linux是一个操作系统的内核，它仅仅是操作系统的一小部分。你所说的Linux，实际还包含了很多软件。这些软件并不是莱纳斯·托瓦尔兹（Linus Torvalds）开发的。它们是由GNU工程的志愿者开发的，这些志愿者用自己的业余时间创造了这些软件，让用户最终可以自由使用的一个操作系统。如果不提及这些开发人员的工作，那是既不礼貌，也不尊重历史的。所以我坚持把这个操作系统称作GNU/Linux，也希望请你这么称呼它。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Taking the words down in my reporter's notebook, I notice an eerie silence in the crowded room. When I finally look up, I find Stallman's unblinking eyes waiting for me. Timidly, a second reporter throws out a question, making sure to use the term ``GNU/Linux'' instead of Linux. Miguel de Icaza, leader of the GNOME project, fields the question. It isn't until halfway through de Icaza's answer, however, that Stallman's eyes finally unlock from mine. As soon as they do, a mild shiver rolls down my back. When Stallman starts lecturing another reporter over a perceived error in diction, I feel a guilty tinge of relief. At least he isn't looking at me, I tell myself.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
把这段话记在采访本上时，我感到整个会场异常地安静。等到我抬起头来，才看到理查德的眼睛眨都不眨地盯着我，让我心生一丝胆怯。这时候，另外一名记者提问，正确地使用了GNU/Linux的名字，才打破僵局。GNOME项目的组长，米格尔·德·伊卡萨回答了这名记者的问题。米格尔回答到一半，理查德才把目光从我身上移开。这时我才觉得些许放松。等到理查德继续纠正了另外一个记者的措辞问题后，我才有种罪孽被洗清的感觉。他起码不再盯着我了——我对自己说。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
For Stallman, such face-to-face moments would serve their purpose. By the end of the first LinuxWorld show, most reporters know better than to use the term ``Linux'' in his presence, and Wired.com is running a story comparing Stallman to a pre-Stalinist revolutionary erased from the history books by hackers and entrepreneurs eager to downplay the GNU Project's overly political objectives.\endnote{See Leander Kahney (1999).} Other articles follow, and while few reporters call the operating system GNU/Linux in print, most are quick to credit Stallman for launching the drive to build a free software operating system 15 years before.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
从理查德的角度看，这种面对面的时刻是有意义的。这次大会结束的时候，各路记者在理查德面前已经改用GNU/Linux这名字。而《连线》的记者则开始忙着写一篇通讯，其中把理查德比作斯大林之前的革命者，被黑客和各大公司从历史上抹去了姓名，他们还闭口不谈GNU工程，因为不喜欢GNU工程中的政治目标\endnote{参见利安得·克尼的文章《被Linux遗忘的人》，《连线》，1999年3月5日： http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/1999/03/18291}。其他的报道也相继出现，尽管没有在报道中使用GNU/Linux的名字，但它们大多都提及了理查德的贡献，说到他十五年前发起的开发自由操作系统的项目。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
I won't meet Stallman again for another 17 months. During the interim, Stallman will revisit Silicon Valley once more for the August, 1999 LinuxWorld show. Although not invited to speak, Stallman does manage to deliver the event's best line. Accepting the show's Linus Torvalds Award for Community Service -- an award named after Linux creator Linus Torvalds -- on behalf of the Free Software Foundation, Stallman wisecracks, ``Giving the Linus Torvalds Award to the Free Software Foundation is a bit like giving the Han Solo Award to the Rebel Alliance.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
再次见到理查德，是17个月后。在这17个月中间，理查德又一次前往位于硅谷的圣何塞，参加1999年8月的第二届LinuxWorld大会。尽管没有演讲，但理查德此次还是有目的的。他是代表自由软件基金会，领取莱纳斯·托瓦尔兹社区贡献奖。理查德接受奖杯的时候，打趣道：“这次代表自由软件基金会领取莱纳斯·托瓦尔兹社区贡献奖，感觉就像唐僧代表师徒四人去领取悟空奖。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
This time around, however, the comments fail to make much of a media dent. Midway through the week, Red Hat, Inc., a prominent GNU/Linux vendor, goes public. The news merely confirms what many reporters such as myself already suspect: ``Linux'' has become a Wall Street buzzword, much like ``e-commerce'' and ``dot-com'' before it. With the stock market approaching the Y2K rollover like a hyperbola approaching its vertical asymptote, all talk of free software or open source as a political phenomenon falls by the wayside.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
可惜，这次的玩笑并没有吸引多少媒体的关注。倒是这周的红帽公司（Red Hat, Inc.）上市，引起了各路记者的关注。这是一家以发布GNU/Linux发行版为主的软件公司\endnote{译注：如今红帽公司的业务已经逐渐扩大，并不仅仅以发布发行版为主。但依然以GNU/Linux的各种解决方案为核心。}。这次上市，印证了我们大多数记者的猜测：“Linux”一词，会和“电子商务”，“点com”等一样，成为华尔街上的流行语。股票市场的热闹会把大家搞得像中了千年虫病毒一般，忘掉过去，丢掉历史，把自由软件或开源的政治方面抛诸脑后。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Maybe that's why, when LinuxWorld follows up its first two shows with a third LinuxWorld show in August, 2000, Stallman is conspicuously absent.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
也许这就是为什么，在2000年第三届LinuxWorld大会上，大家再也没看到理查德的身影。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
My second encounter with Stallman and his trademark gaze comes shortly after that third LinuxWorld show. Hearing that Stallman is going to be in Silicon Valley, I set up a lunch interview in Palo Alto, California. The meeting place seems ironic, not only because of his absence from the show but also because of the overall backdrop. Outside of Redmond, Washington, few cities offer a more direct testament to the economic value of proprietary software. Curious to see how Stallman, a man who has spent the better part of his life railing against our culture's predilection toward greed and selfishness, is coping in a city where even garage-sized bungalows run in the half-million-dollar price range, I make the drive down from Oakland.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
我第二次再和理查德见面，是在第三届LinuxWorld大会之后不久。当时我听说理查德又要来硅谷，我就和他联系好，定在加利福尼亚州帕罗奥多市（Palo Alto）进行采访。这个地点选的很有意思。不仅仅是因为他上次缺席LinuxWorld大会，还因为这里作为硅谷重镇，是除了微软所在的华盛顿州雷蒙德市以外，最支持专有软件经济模型的几个城市之一。而理查德则花费了自己整个青春和大半生的时间，去与我们文化之中的自私与贪婪作斗争。我很好奇，他来到这座城市，看着车库大小的平房里，都在做着几十万美元的买卖的现实，理查德会作何反应。带着好奇心，我离开奥克兰市，驱车前往帕罗奥多。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
I follow the directions Stallman has given me, until I reach the headquarters of Art.net, a nonprofit ``virtual artists collective.'' Located in a hedge-shrouded house in the northern corner of the city, the Art.net headquarters are refreshingly run-down. Suddenly, the idea of Stallman lurking in the heart of Silicon Valley doesn't seem so strange after all.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
按照理查德给我的地址，我来到了Art.net的总部。这是一家汇集各路“网上艺术家”的非盈利组织。位于城市北部，坐落在一所被篱笆围起来的房子里。房子有些旧，但又透着些小清新。这氛围顿时又让我觉得，理查德混在硅谷，似乎也不是个很怪的想法。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
I find Stallman sitting in a darkened room, tapping away on his gray laptop computer. He looks up as soon as I enter the room, giving me a full blast of his 200-watt gaze. When he offers a soothing ``Hello,'' I offer a return greeting. Before the words come out, however, his eyes have already shifted back to the laptop screen.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
我看到理查德坐在一个背阴的房间里，正在他那台灰色笔记本电脑上敲着键盘。我一进门，他就看着我，投来了那著名的目光。互相寒暄，他又把目光聚焦回笔记本屏幕上。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``I'm just finishing an article on the spirit of hacking,'' Stallman says, fingers still tapping. ``Take a look.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“我刚刚写了一篇关于黑客精神的文章。”理查德一边打字，一边说：“过来看看？”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
I take a look. The room is dimly lit, and the text appears as greenish-white letters on a black background, a reversal of the color scheme used by most desktop word-processing programs, so it takes my eyes a moment to adjust. When they do, I find myself reading Stallman's account of a recent meal at a Korean restaurant. Before the meal, Stallman makes an interesting discovery: the person setting the table has left six chopsticks instead of the usual two in front of Stallman's place setting. Where most restaurant goers would have ignored the redundant pairs, Stallman takes it as challenge: find a way to use all six chopsticks at once. Like many software hacks, the successful solution is both clever and silly at the same time. Hence Stallman's decision to use it as an illustration.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
我走过去开始读文章。房间阴暗，屏幕上的编辑软件主题，又被理查德设置成了黑底绿字。我读了几个字，眼睛才逐渐适应。文章开始回忆了理查德有次去一家韩国餐馆的经历。当时服务员摆桌的时候，在理查德面前放了三双筷子。一般人恐怕都会把多余的两双筷子拿开。可理查德却又借此开始玩起把戏，他企图找个法子，用上所有的筷子。和很多黑客技巧一样，最终的解决方案既聪明灵巧，可又傻里傻气。理查德以这个事情来作为整个文章的引子。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
As I read the story, I feel Stallman watching me intently. I look over to notice a proud but child-like half smile on his face. When I praise the essay, my comment barely merits a raised eyebrow.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
我读的时候，感觉理查德一直在盯着我。起身看了他一眼，见他一脸骄傲的表情，好似孩子般笑着站在那。我夸奖了一下他的文章，勉强让他眉毛抬了抬。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``I'll be ready to go in a moment,'' he says.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“稍等一下，我们马上就出发。”他说。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Stallman goes back to tapping away at his laptop. The laptop is gray and boxy, not like the sleek, modern laptops that seemed to be a programmer favorite at the recent LinuxWorld show. Above the keyboard rides a smaller, lighter keyboard, a testament to Stallman's aging hands. During the mid 1990s, the pain in Stallman's hands became so unbearable that he had to hire a typist. Today, Stallman relies on a keyboard whose keys require less pressure than a typical computer keyboard.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
理查德坐回座位，开始继续敲键盘。他用的笔记本是个灰色的四方盒子，和LinuxWorld上看到的大多笔记本不同，理查德的这台没那么光鲜亮丽，也不是什么新款式。笔记本的键盘之上，还放着一个更小，更轻的键盘。理查德的一双大手，则在这个小键盘上飞舞。九十年代中期，理查德双手的剧痛让他无法容忍，以至于他曾一度雇用了一位打字员。今天，他用的键盘，是一种特殊的，比常规键盘按键力度更小的键盘。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Stallman has a tendency to block out all external stimuli while working. Watching his eyes lock onto the screen and his fingers dance, one quickly gets the sense of two old friends locked in deep conversation.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
理查德在工作时，会全然不顾外界刺激。看着他眼睛盯着屏幕，手指飞舞，让人觉得理查德和电脑，恰似老友重逢，当下正促膝长谈。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
The session ends with a few loud keystrokes and the slow disassembly of the laptop.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
理查德用力敲了几下键盘，合上笔记本电脑，拔掉电源，结束了写作。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``Ready for lunch?'' Stallman asks.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“吃午饭去吧？”理查德问。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
We walk to my car. Pleading a sore ankle, Stallman limps along slowly. Stallman blames the injury on a tendon in his left foot. The injury is three years old and has gotten so bad that Stallman, a huge fan of folk dancing, has been forced to give up all dancing activities. ``I love folk dancing intensely,'' Stallman laments. ``Not being able to dance has been a tragedy for me.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
理查德抱怨着自己脚踝的伤，和我一起徐步走到我的车前。他左脚跟腱三年前受了伤，让他这么一个民间舞爱好者从此告别任何舞蹈活动。理查德叹道：“我可喜欢跳舞了，不能跳舞对我来说简直是个悲剧。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Stallman's body bears witness to the tragedy. Lack of exercise has left Stallman with swollen cheeks and a pot belly that was much less visible the year before. You can tell the weight gain has been dramatic, because when Stallman walks, he arches his back like a pregnant woman trying to accommodate an unfamiliar load.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
这悲剧从理查德的身材上就体现出来了。由于缺乏锻炼，理查德开始发福。脸颊越来越圆，啤酒肚也凸出来了。你能明显看出，他发胖简直就是一瞬间完成的。他自己都还来不及适应，以至于在走路的时候，都要撑着腰，好似一个孕妇一般。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
The walk is further slowed by Stallman's willingness to stop and smell the roses, literally. Spotting a particularly beautiful blossom, he strokes the innermost petals against his nose, takes a deep sniff, and steps back with a contented sigh.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
走到中途，理查德停下脚步，在一簇玫瑰花前伏下身子。剥开花瓣，理查德把鼻子凑到花蕊前，深吸一口气，然后起身长叹，甚是满足。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``Mmm, rhinophytophilia,'' he says, rubbing his back.\endnote{At the time, I thought Stallman was referring to the flower's scientific name. Months later, I would learn that \textit{rhinophytophilia} was in fact a humorous reference to the activity -- i.e., Stallman's sticking his nose into a flower and enjoying the moment -- presenting it as the kinky practice of nasal sex with plants. For another humorous Stallman flower incident, visit: \url{http://www.stallman.org/articles/texas.html}.}
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“嗯，rhinophytophilia。”他揉揉腰说。\endnote{开始，我还以为理查德说的是这花的学名。几个月后，我才发现理查德所谓的rhinophytophilia，原来也是他的一个玩笑。他实际是把嗅花的行为比作用鼻子和花做爱。更多理查德关于花的玩笑，参见：http://www.stallman.org/articles/texas.html 。译注：rhinophytophilia是理查德自创的一个希腊词汇。rhino意为“鼻子”；phyto意为“花”；philia意为“爱”。}
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
The drive to the restaurant takes less than three minutes. Upon recommendation from Tim Ney, former executive director of the Free Software Foundation, I have let Stallman choose the restaurant. While some reporters zero in on Stallman's monk-like lifestyle, the truth is, Stallman is a committed epicure when it comes to food. One of the fringe benefits of being a traveling missionary for the free software cause is the ability to sample delicious food from around the world. ``Visit almost any major city in the world, and chances are Richard knows the best restaurant in town,'' says Ney. ``Richard also takes great pride in knowing what's on the menu and ordering for the entire the table.''  (If they are willing, that is.)
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
开车到餐馆不到三分钟。根据前自由软件基金会执行总监蒂姆·内伊（Tim Ney）的建议，我让理查德选择去哪家餐馆。尽管很多报道，把理查德描述成苦行僧一般，可事实上，理查德在饮食方面，可谓是个美食家。作为一个布道全球的自由软件使者，一个额外收获就是可以尝遍各地美食。内伊介绍：“他去了几乎全世界所有的主要城市，这让他总能知道全城最好的餐馆在哪。理查德知道菜单上每个菜都是什么，点上一桌美食，他经常以此为荣。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
For today's meal, Stallman has chosen a Cantonese-style dim sum restaurant two blocks off University Avenue, Palo Alto's main drag. The choice is partially inspired by Stallman's recent visit to China, including a stop in Hong Kong, in addition to Stallman's personal aversion to spicier Hunanese and Szechuan cuisine. ``I'm not a big fan of spicy,'' Stallman admits.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
今天，理查德选择了一家广式点心店。这家店和帕罗奥多市的主干道学院街（University Ave.）相隔两个街区。选这里，一部分是因为理查德刚刚去过中国，期间在香港做了短暂停留。理查德本人并不喜欢太辣的东西，所以他并不喜欢川菜和湘菜。“我对辣的东西不感冒。”理查德坦言。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
We arrive a few minutes after 11 a.m. and find ourselves already subject to a 20-minute wait. Given the hacker aversion to lost time, I hold my breath momentarily, fearing an outburst. Stallman, contrary to expectations, takes the news in stride.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
快十一点的时候，我们赶到餐馆。结果发现居然在餐馆的门前已经排了长队，我们要等二十分钟才能入席。我深知黑客们不喜欢浪费时间，于是屏住呼吸，生怕理查德大动肝火。可出乎意料，理查德竟然坦然接受了这个事实。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``It's too bad we couldn't have found somebody else to join us,'' he tells me. ``It's always more fun to eat with a group of people.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
理查德对我说：“就只有我们俩来了，真可惜。人多了吃起来才热闹。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
During the wait, Stallman practices a few dance steps. His moves are tentative but skilled. We discuss current events. Stallman says his only regret about not attending LinuxWorld was missing out on a press conference announcing the launch of the GNOME Foundation. Backed by Sun Microsystems and IBM, the foundation is in many ways a vindication for Stallman, who has long championed that free software and free-market economics need not be mutually exclusive. Nevertheless, Stallman remains dissatisfied by the message that came out.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
等待期间，理查德开始走起舞步。他步步小心，可还是能看出有功底。我们开始聊起时事。理查德说，这次缺席LinuxWorld大会，最遗憾的部分是没能出席GNOME基金会的成立发布会。这个基金会是Sun公司和IBM一手操办，它很好地诠释了理查德的观点：所谓自由软件，并不与自由市场和自由经济相冲突。然而，理查德依旧不满意大会的论调。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``The way it was presented, the companies were talking about Linux with no mention of the GNU Project at all,'' Stallman says.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“发布的时候，各个公司都在说着Linux，闭口不提GNU工程。”理查德说。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Such disappointments merely contrast the warm response coming from overseas, especially Asia, Stallman notes. A quick glance at the Stallman 2000 travel itinerary bespeaks the growing popularity of the free software message. Between recent visits to India, China, and Brazil, Stallman has spent 12 of the last 115 days on United States soil. His travels have given him an opportunity to see how the free software concept translates into different languages of cultures.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
这种冷漠恰恰和地球另一边的热络形成对比。尤其是亚洲各国，甚是热情。看看理查德2000年的行程安排，就能看出自由软件的迅猛增长。在115天之中，理查德只在美国停留了12天，其他时间，则在印度，中国或巴西境内。他的旅行，让他见识了自由软件如何被翻译成不同语言，进入各国文化。
\fi

``In India many people are interested in free software, because they see it as a way to build their computing infrastructure without spending a lot of money,'' Stallman says. ``In China, the concept has been much slower to catch on. Comparing free software to free speech is harder to do when you don't have any free speech. Still, the level of interest in free software during my last visit was profound.''

“在印度，很多人对自由软件感兴趣。因为他们觉得这样可以用很低的成本，建设起自己的计算机基础设施。”理查德说：“在中国，自由软件的概念就传播得相对慢了一些。我们经常把软件自由和言论自由并提，表示这是软件用户的一种基本自由，可在中国，这种类比显然不太奏效。不过无论如何，我这次的中国之行，还是在一定程度上提高了自由软件的关注度。”

The conversation shifts to Napster, the San Mateo, California software company, which has become something of a media cause célèbre in recent months. The company markets a controversial software tool that lets music fans browse and copy the music files of other music fans. Thanks to the magnifying powers of the Internet, this so-called ``peer-to-peer'' program has evolved into a de facto online jukebox, giving ordinary music fans a way to listen to MP3 music files over the computer without paying a royalty or fee, much to record companies' chagrin.

话题很快转到Napster，这是一家加利福尼亚州圣马特奥市的软件公司。这几个月，这家公司成了各大媒体的宠儿。这家公司开发了一款倍受争议的软件，使得音乐爱好者之间可以互相拷贝音乐文件。借着互联网的东风，这类称作p2p（即端到端）的软件逐渐流行。如今，Napster俨然成了大型音乐盒，让各路音乐爱好者可以免费欣赏音乐。这一下子就惹恼了各大唱片公司。

Although based on proprietary software, the Napster system draws inspiration from the long-held Stallman contention that once a work enters the digital realm -- in other words, once making a copy is less a matter of duplicating sounds or duplicating atoms and more a matter of duplicating information -- the natural human impulse to share a work becomes harder to restrict. Rather than impose additional restrictions, Napster execs have decided to take advantage of the impulse. Giving music listeners a central place to trade music files, the company has gambled on its ability to steer the resulting user traffic toward other commercial opportunities.

尽管Napster是个专有软件，但它的流行却印证了理查德的想法：一旦某个作品进入数字世界，或者说，一旦复制这个作品变得便宜简单，那么人类本能地分享这个作品的行为将会难以阻止。Napster给了用户一片分享音乐的空间，这家公司接着就可以借助用户量来寻求更多商业机会。

The sudden success of the Napster model has put the fear in traditional record companies, with good reason. Just days before my Palo Alto meeting with Stallman, U.S. District Court Judge Marilyn Patel granted a request filed by the Recording Industry Association of America for an injunction against the file-sharing service. The injunction was subsequently suspended by the U.S. Ninth District Court of Appeals, but by early 2001, the Court of Appeals, too, would find the San Mateo-based company in breach of copyright law,\endnote{See Cecily Barnes and Scott Ard, ``Court Grants Stay of Napster Injunction,'' \textit{News.com} (July 28, 2000), \url{http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-2376465.html}.} a decision RIAA spokesperson Hillary Rosen would later proclaim a ``clear victory for the creative content community and the legitimate online marketplace.''\endnote{See ``A Clear Victory for Recording Industry in Napster Case,'' RIAA press release (February 12, 2001), \url{http://www.riaa.com/PR_story.cfm?id=372}.}

Napster的迅猛成功让各大唱片公司开始担心。我来帕罗奥多之前的几天，玛莉莲·帕特尔法官刚刚在美国地方法院通过了一项由美国唱片协会提交的禁令。该禁令禁止了文件共享服务。而Napster之后上诉到上诉法院，使得这个禁令被美国第九巡回上诉法院暂停。但在2001年年初，上诉法院判定Napster的确违反了版权法\endnote{..........}。美国唱片协会发言人希拉里·罗森对这个判决的评价是：“保护了创作者，完善了在线市场方面的法律\endnote{...........}。”

For hackers such as Stallman, the Napster business model is troublesome in different ways. The company's eagerness to appropriate time-worn hacker principles such as file sharing and communal information ownership, while at the same time selling a service based on proprietary software, sends a distressing mixed message. As a person who already has a hard enough time getting his own carefully articulated message into the media stream, Stallman is understandably reticent when it comes to speaking out about the company. Still, Stallman does admit to learning a thing or two from the social side of the Napster phenomenon.

对于理查德这样的黑客来说，Napster的商业模型内包涵着复杂的信息。一方面，这家公司大力倡导黑客社区所欣赏的信息共享精神；而另一方面，又出售着基于专有软件的服务。这种复杂性，让理查德对这一事件少言寡语，因为他知道，自己已经花了很大功夫去传播自己的思想，而对这种部分和自己思想相同；但很大程度又有矛盾的事件发表评论，很容易被媒体断章取义，平添混乱。可理查德依旧承认，从Napster事件上，他也认识到了一些有价值的东西。

``Before Napster, I thought it might be [sufficient] for people to privately redistribute works of entertainment,'' Stallman says. ``The number of people who find Napster useful, however, tells me that the right to redistribute copies not only on a neighbor-to-neighbor basis, but to the public at large, is essential and therefore may not be taken away.''

The conversation segues into a discussion of Korean cuisine. During the same June, 2000, Asian tour, Stallman paid a visit to South Korea. His arrival ignited a mini-firestorm in the local media thanks to a Korean software conference attended by Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates that same week. Next to getting his photo above Gates's photo on the front page of the top Seoul newspaper, Stallman says the best thing about the trip was the food. ``I had a bowl of naeng myun, which is cold noodles,'' says Stallman. ``These were a very interesting feeling noodle. Most places don't use quite the same kind of noodles for your naeng myun, so I can say with complete certainty that this was the most exquisite naeng myun I ever had.''

这讨论接着又转向韩国菜。同样也是在2000年6月，理查德的亚洲之行中，也去了韩国。他的到来，在当地媒体引起了一个不小的轰动，这部分原因，或许还要部分归功于当时也在韩国的微软创始人比尔·盖茨。理查德的照片这次上了首尔的热销报纸的头版，把比尔·盖茨的照片竟然挤到了下面。除了这件事情让理查德非常满意之外，当地的美食也让他欢欣鼓舞。他回忆：“我吃了一碗冷面。那面条口感非常独特，我们这边都不用那种面条做冷面。我敢肯定，那冷面是我有生以来吃到的最正点的冷面。”

After a brief sigh, Stallman recovers. The moment gives me a chance to discuss Stallman's reputation vis-à-vis the fairer sex. The reputation is a bit contradictory at times.

I mention a passage from the 1999 book \textit{Open Sources} in which Stallman confesses to wanting to name the GNU kernel after a girlfriend at the time. The girlfriend's name was Alix, a name that fit perfectly with the Unix developer convention of putting an ``x'' at the end names of operating systems and kernels -- e.g., ``Linux.'' Alix was a Unix system administrator, and had suggested to her friends, ``Someone should name a kernel after me.'' So Stallman decided to name the GNU kernel ``Alix'' as a surprise for her. The kernel's main developer renamed the kernel ``Hurd,'' but retained the name ``Alix'' for part of it.  One of Alix's friends noticed this part in a source snapshot and told her, and she was touched.  A later redesign of the Hurd eliminated that part.\endnote{See Richard Stallman, ``The GNU Operating System and the Free Software Movement,'' \textit{Open Sources} (O'Reilly \& Associates, Inc., 1999): 65. [RMS: Williams interpreted this vignette as suggesting that I am a hopeless romantic, and that my efforts were meant to impress some as-yet-unidentified woman.  No MIT hacker would believe this, since we learned quite young that most women wouldn't notice us, let alone love us, for our programming.  We programmed because it was fascinating.  Meanwhile, these events were only possible because I had a thoroughly identified girlfriend at the time.  If I was a romantic, at the time I was neither a hopeless romantic nor a hopeful romantic, but rather temporarily a successful one.

On the strength of that naive interpretation, Williams went on to compare me to Don Quijote.

For completeness' sake, here's a somewhat inarticulate quote from the first edition: ``I wasn't really trying to be romantic. It was more of a teasing thing. I mean, it was romantic, but it was also teasing, you know? It would have been a delightful surprise.'']}

``I heard some people speaking Shanghainese the last time I was in China,'' Stallman says. ``It was interesting to hear. It sounded quite different [from Mandarin]. I had them tell me some cognate words in Mandarin and Shanghainese. In some cases you can see the resemblance, but one question I was wondering about was whether tones would be similar. They're not. That's interesting to me, because there's a theory that the tones evolved from additional syllables that got lost and replaced. Their effect survives in the tone. If that's true, and I've seen claims that that happened within historic times, the dialects must have diverged before the loss of these final syllables.''

Stallman points to his taste in music as a key example of his contrarian tendencies. As a teenager, when most of his high school classmates were listening to Motown and acid rock, Stallman preferred classical music.

When it comes to copyrighted works, Stallman says he divides the world into three categories. The first category involves ``functional'' works -- e.g., software programs, dictionaries, and textbooks. The second category involves works that might best be described as ``testimonial'' -- e.g., scientific papers and historical documents. Such works serve a purpose that would be undermined if subsequent readers or authors were free to modify the work at will.  It also includes works of personal expression -- e.g., diaries, journals, and autobiographies. To modify such documents would be to alter a person's recollections or point of view, which Stallman considers ethically unjustifiable.  The third category includes works of art and entertainment.

当说起版权作品的时候，理查德把整个领域分为三个类型。第一个类型，是所谓的“功能类”。软件，辞典，教科书都属于此类。第二个类型，可以称为“证据类”。科技论文，古籍文献都属于此类。这些作品，如果可以被任意修改，则没有了价值。这一类也同样包括对个人感受的记录，比如日记，游记，自传。修改这些作品，则会影响到对某人的回忆或观点。因此理查德觉得对此类作品，读者则不能有权修改。第三类，则是“艺术类”，包含了艺术和娱乐作品。

Of the three categories, the first should give users the unlimited right to make modified versions, while the second and third should regulate that right according to the will of the original author. Regardless of category, however, the freedom to copy and redistribute noncommercially should remain unabridged at all times, Stallman insists. If that means giving Internet users the right to generate a hundred copies of an article, image, song, or book and then email the copies to a hundred strangers, so be it. ``It's clear that private occasional redistribution must be permitted, because only a police state can stop that,'' Stallman says. ``It's antisocial to come between people and their friends. Napster has convinced me that we also need to permit, must permit, even noncommercial redistribution to the public for the fun of it. Because so many people want to do that and find it so useful.''

这三类作品中，应该无条件赋予用户权力去修改的是“功能类”的作品；而对于“证据类”和“艺术类”作品，则要根据作者意愿，才能赋予用户一定的修改权力。理查德坚信，无论哪类作品，用户出于非商业目的的复制与分享行为都应该被允许。如果说，一旦允许如此，就会有互联网用户把各种图片，音乐或者书籍复制成百上千份，然后把拷贝发送给几百个陌生人，那么也要允许这种行为。“很显然，私下偶尔分享这些作品的行为，必须被允许。只有警察国家才会禁止这些行为。”理查德说。“把一个人和他的朋友隔离，这是反社会的行为。而Napster事件则让我觉得，我们不仅要允许私下朋友之间的分享，更应该，也必须要允许用户，出于非商业目的，把这些作品的拷贝分享给公众。因为太多的人希望如此，并且觉得这么做非常有价值。”

When I ask whether the courts would accept such a permissive outlook, Stallman cuts me off.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
我问他，法庭是不是会接受这种放任的观点。理查德打断了我说：
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
``That's the wrong question,'' he says. ``I mean now you've changed the subject entirely from one of ethics to one of interpreting laws. And those are two totally different questions in the same field. It's useless to jump from one to the other. How the courts would interpret the existing laws is mainly in a harsh way, because that's the way these laws have been bought by publishers.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
“这是个错误的问题。你把这个话题从道德伦理的领域，转移成了法律领域里的释法问题。这是一个话题的两个完全不同的方面。从一个反面跳到另一个是没有任何意义的。法庭如何解释现有法律是有严格规定的，而这些法律也接着这些规定被各路出版商搬上台面。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
The comment provides an insight into Stallman's political philosophy: just because the legal system currently backs up businesses' ability to treat copyright as the software equivalent of land title doesn't mean computer users have to play the game according to those rules. Freedom is an ethical issue, not a legal issue. ``I'm looking beyond what the existing laws are to what they should be,'' Stallman says. ``I'm not trying to draft legislation. I'm thinking about what should the law do? I consider the law prohibiting the sharing of copies with your friend the moral equivalent of Jim Crow. It does not deserve respect.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
这段话反映出了理查德的政治哲学：现有的法律系统保护各大公司，让他们能利用现有版权法保护自己的软件，但这并不意味着计算机用户必须得遵守所谓的规则。自由本身是个伦理问题，不是法律问题。他说：“我们需要超越现有法律，暂时忘记现在实际是什么样，去思考我们究竟应该要什么样。我不是要立法，而是在考虑法律应该做些什么。我觉得，禁止朋友之间分享拷贝的法律，和种族歧视法律一样，不该得到尊重。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
The invocation of Jim Crow prompts another question. How much influence or inspiration does Stallman draw from past political leaders? Like the civil-rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, his attempt to drive social change is based on an appeal to timeless values: freedom, justice, and fair play.
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
说起种族歧视法，我又问了另外一个问题：他是否被曾经的那些政治领袖影响或鼓舞？比如五六十年代的民权运动，理查德的政治思想也是基于类似的普世价值：自由，正义，公平竞争。

Stallman divides his attention between my analogy and a particularly tangled strand of hair. When I stretch the analogy to the point where I'm comparing Stallman with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Stallman, after breaking off a split end and popping it into his mouth, cuts me off.

I suggest Malcolm X as another point of comparison. Like the former Nation of Islam spokesperson, Stallman has built up a reputation for courting controversy, alienating potential allies, and preaching a message favoring self-sufficiency over cultural integration.

我接着提起另外一位民权活动家，马尔科姆·艾克斯（Malcolm X），把他的观点和理查德的做类比。马尔科姆曾是美国非洲裔人的新宗教组织“伊斯兰国度”的领袖。和他一样，理查德也喜欢谈论有争议的话题，疏远潜在的盟友，并且传播着一套自恰的信息，无视与现有文化体系的整合。
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Chewing on another split end, Stallman rejects the comparison. ``My message is closer to King's message,'' he says. ``It's a universal message. It's a message of firm condemnation of certain practices that mistreat others. It's not a message of hatred for anyone. And it's not aimed at a narrow group of people. I invite anyone to value freedom and to have freedom.''
\fi

\ifdefined\chs
理查德嚼完嘴里的东西，表示他拒绝这种类比：“我要传达的内容更类似马丁·路德·金的思想。这是一个普世价值观。它谴责一些伤及他人的行为。我的思想并不是要人去憎恨谁，也不是针对一小撮人。我希望每个人都能珍视自由，也能拥有自由。”
\fi

\ifdefined\eng
Many criticize Stallman for rejecting handy political alliances; some psychologize this and describe it as a character trait. In the case of his well-publicized distaste for the term ``open source,'' the unwillingness to participate in recent coalition-building projects seems understandable. As a man who has spent the last two decades stumping on the behalf of free software, Stallman's political capital is deeply invested in the term. Still, comments such as the ``Han Solo'' comparison at the 1999 LinuxWorld have only reinforced Stallman's reputation, amongst those who believe virtue consists of following the crowd, as a disgruntled mossback unwilling to roll with political or marketing trends.

很多人都指责理查德，说他经常拒绝触手可得的政治盟友。有人从心理学的角度，认为这是理查德的一个性格特征。他拒绝使用已经被大众接受的“开源”一词，拒绝与这个圈子的人合作项目。他为自由软件奋斗了二十多年，他的名字已经深深地和自由软件绑在了一起，他的政治资本也是要不断投资在这四个字上。在LinuxWorld上领奖时，他的那番类比，更加深了人们对他的这一印象。茫茫众生之间，很多人早已把跟风赶潮当作一种美德。而理查德在这些人之中，则更显得头脑守旧，不肯在政治大趋势和市场面前有半点让步。

[RMS: The term ``friends'' only partly fits people such as Young, and companies such as Red Hat.  It applies to some of what they did, and do: for instance, Red Hat contributes to development of free software, including some GNU programs.  But Red Hat does other things that work against the free software movement's goals -- for instance, its versions of GNU/Linux contain nonfree software.  Turning from deeds to words, referring to the whole system as ``Linux'' is unfriendly treatment of the GNU Project, and promoting ``open source'' instead of ``free software'' rejects our values.  I could work with Young and Red Hat when we were going in the same direction, but that was not often enough to make them possible allies.]

[RMS: “朋友”一词只能部分地适用与罗伯特·杨和红帽公司的身上。他们做的一些事情，确实称得上是朋友。比如，红帽公司为自由软件开发贡献了很多，这其中包括很多GNU工程的程序。但红包公司也同样做了一些违背自由软件运动主旨的事情。比如，他们的GNU/Linux发行版中，就包含一些非自由软件。从措词上看，他们把整个系统称为Linux，是对GNU工程的无视。他们宣扬“开源”的同时，不考虑自由软件，也是违背我们的价值观。如果红帽公司和罗伯特·杨能与我们同道，我乐意和他们一起共同协作。可很多时候，并非如此。]

Stallman's reluctance to ally the free software movement with other political causes is not due to lack of interest in them.  Visit his offices at MIT, and you instantly find a clearinghouse of left-leaning news articles covering civil-rights abuses around the globe. Visit his personal web site, \url{stallman.org}, and you'll find attacks on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the War on Drugs, and the World Trade Organization.  Stallman explains, ``We have to be careful of entering the free software movement into alliances with other political causes that substantial numbers of free software supporters might not agree with.  For instance, we avoid linking the free software movement with any political party because we do not want to drive away the supporters and elected officials of other parties.''

理查德这种独行侠的作风，并非是他不关注其他政治人物。在他MIT的办公室里，你能一下子看到很多左派文章，记录着全球各地公民权被侵犯的事件。登陆他的个人网站，stallman.org，你可以看到很多文章，反对千禧年版权法案，抵制反毒品运动，抵制世贸组织等等。理查德解释说：“我们必须要谨慎地为自由软件运动挑选政治盟友。因为有些自由软件支持者也许并不支持有些运动。比如，我们会避免把自由软件运动和其他政党建立联系，因为我们不希望这样的行为去驱散那些自由软件的支持者。”

Given his activist tendencies, I ask, why hasn't Stallman sought a larger voice? Why hasn't he used his visibility in the hacker world as a platform to boost his political voice?  [RMS: But I do -- when I see a good opportunity.  That's why I started \url{stallman.org}.]

Stallman lets his tangled hair drop and contemplates the question for a moment. [RMS:  My quoted response doesn't fit that question.

``I hesitate to exaggerate the importance of this little puddle of freedom,'' he says. ``Because the more well-known and conventional areas of working for freedom and a better society are tremendously important. I wouldn't say that free software is as important as they are. It's the responsibility I undertook, because it dropped in my lap and I saw a way I could do something about it. But, for example, to end police brutality, to end the war on drugs, to end the kinds of racism we still have, to help everyone have a comfortable life, to protect the rights of people who do abortions, to protect us from theocracy, these are tremendously important issues, far more important than what I do. I just wish I knew how to do something about them.''

答道：“软件自由，仅仅是自由一隅，冰山一角。我不希望过分强调这一角。因为还有更多的领域需要自由，这一点十分重要。和这些自由相比，自由软件则显得微不足道了。自由软件是我的一份责任，因为这项自由恰好落在我熟悉的领域之中。可除此以外，还有很多极其重要的问题需要关注：警察暴力，刑讯逼供；人们对某些毒品的偏见；种族歧视；如何让人们过上安逸的生活；如何让有堕胎经历的人免遭歧视；如何避免极权政治等等。这些都和我们的生活息息相关，它们都比我的工作重要。我只是希望能了解如何在这些问题上做点什么。”

Once again, Stallman presents his political activity as a function of personal confidence. Given the amount of time it has taken him to develop and hone the free software movement's core tenets, Stallman is hesitant to believe he can advance the other causes he supports.

Chewing a final split end, Stallman suggests paying the check. Before the waiter can take it away, however, Stallman pulls out a white-colored dollar bill and throws it on the pile. The bill looks so clearly counterfeit, I can't help but pick it up and read it. Sure enough, it did not come from the US Mint. Instead of bearing the image of a George Washington or Abe Lincoln, the bill's front side bears the image of a cartoon pig. Instead of the United States of America, the banner above the pig reads, ``Untied Status of Avarice.'' The bill is for zero dollars,\endnote{RMS: Williams was mistaken to call this bill ``counterfeit.'' It is legal tender, worth zero dollars for payment of any debt.  Any U.S. government office will convert it into zero dollars' worth of gold.} and when the waiter picks up the money, Stallman makes sure to tug on his sleeve.
